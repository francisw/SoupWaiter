== Description ==
# Your Vacation Rental Marketing Engine
Vacation Soup exists to empower VR owners to break-away from the Online Travel Agents that eat away at your hard-earned profit.

We provide:
* [expert training](https://learn.vacationsoup.com \"The Learning Centre\") in all aspects of Vacation Rental marketing with hundreds of hours of video tutorials from Alan Egan and the team.
* A vibrant [community](https://community.vacationsoup.com \"Community\") of experts and owners just like you who strive for independence, and want to help you.
* [The Soup](https://vacationsoup.com \"Vacation Soup\") itself, the only destination based travel site written by VR owners, with local secrets, ideas and properties.

What traveller starts their dream vacation by looking for a 4-bed 2-bath property? The secret to Vacation Rental marketing is talking about the experience: the aroma of orange blossom in April, the bustling market, the beach cafe or the best golf courses.

With this plugin you will be coached with ideas to get your words flowing, topics that are trending right now with travellers, one-click royalty-free jaw-dropping photos from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com \"Pixabay\") and, most important of all, you will be **creating** the content of Vacation Soup itself.

== Upgrade Notice ==
We are continually actively updating the plugin, adding new features (and of course removing any bugs), improving security and making sure your Vacation Rental website gets seen by the most people.

As one of the waiter\'s jobs is to link you to the Soup kitchen, sharing your posts around the world, you must upgrade to the latest version whenever prompted to. We recommend you install an auto-update plugin for all WordPress sites.
